## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

Set HTML first, separating contents into upper, middle and lower divs. At larger screens, middle and lower are left and right sections.
Separete text content into paragraphs as realized by screenshots.
Import Google font and set initial CSS styles: reset, root for project colors, and body - background-color, line height and font-size as suggested.
There are a missing color that capture by using eye-drop chrome extension and name as light-cyan.
Set a div container and set grid display, columns and rows template and associate each div section to its area.
Set a media query for desktop size and change grid arrangements.
Set padding for each div section.
Set class for varius font sizes and colors, alone. Set them to paragraph attributes.
Set separate class to the middle line of middle div as the content is center aligned. Set it to flex display.

### Continued development

The tipography is not OK.
Could not find a good solution to space cost and text at middle line of middle div.
